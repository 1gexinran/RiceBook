   The webpage is visually appeal and the color scheme on the website is satisfying. And it's very easy to navigate to the main page.
   The notifications on the login and register page are clear and easily understandable.
   
   Improvements: if would be better if the background is more colorful.

   The login page and register page are straightforward. I like the layout of the mainpage which is clear and appealing. And I also love 
   the LoL team icon. Expecially the 2018 World Champion IG !!
   
   Improvements: The layout on both the login page and register page should more clear. The background color is fine but sometimes it can
   be hard for users to read the content.

   The color scheme and visual organization of the app are appealing. All the functions work fine. The content and layout is clear.
   
   Improvements: Sometimes it could be hard to focus on the contents from the white background. It would be more clear, i think, to          separate the background with the content.
